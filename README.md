This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
//hello
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- 🎯 QuizApp
QuizApp is a ReactJS-based web application that allows users to take assessments by solving multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The application ensures a seamless user experience with validations, scoring, and a final result display.

✨ Features
Interactive Quiz: Users can solve MCQs one question at a time.
Option Selection Validation: Users cannot proceed to the next question without selecting an option.
Dynamic Scoring: Scores are calculated in real-time using a score state variable.
Final Score Display: Once all questions are answered, users are presented with their final score.
User-Friendly Interface: The application provides a smooth and intuitive interface for taking quizzes.
🚀 How It Works
Start the Quiz:

The quiz begins with the first question displayed on the screen.
Option Selection:

Users must select an option to enable the "Next" button.
If no option is selected, the user cannot proceed to the next question.
Score Calculation:

The score is updated dynamically based on the correctness of the selected options.
Final Score:

Once the user completes all questions, the application displays the final score out of the total number of questions.
🛠️ Technologies Used
ReactJS: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
State Management: Managed using React's useState and useEffect hooks.
CSS: For styling the application.
